# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a Tic-tac-toe browser game. For this project, I applied various concepts in JavaScript including Objects, Modules, Factory Functions/Constructors, as well as more formal code organization.

Currently the game only allows for Player vs Player, and the option for Player vs AI will be in a later revision.
